##### What could affect individualâ€™s voting choice? Many have studied the effect of age, gender and education level, but we argued that voting choice should very much result from political ideology. Views on immigrants and religiosity should also paly a role in voting. Using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and the Manifesto Project Dataset, we applied a binary logistic regression model, a multinomial logistic regression, and a conditional logistic regression model to investigate the effect of these variables on voting outcomes. The results suggest that political ideology is a significant factor in party choice. Left leaning parties are more likely to be favored by older voters, female voters, highly educated voters and voters who think positively of immigrants while high level of religiosity makes a voter prefer right leaning parties.
